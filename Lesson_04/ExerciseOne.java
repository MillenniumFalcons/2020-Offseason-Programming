/*
Lesson _04
In this exercise, you will use return functions to calculate the slope between 2 points and the distance between 2 points
If the variable var is equal to 1 then calculate the distance between 2 points
Else If variable var is equal to 2 then calculate the slope between 2 points
Else var does not have an appropriate value.
Good Luck Completing the exercise!
