Offseason Programming Training 
 
## Setting up a programming environment
For the first few lessons where we will be learning some basic concepts of java, we will be programming on [repl.it](https://repl.it/). For later lessons where we will be learning how to program the robot, we will be using Visual Studio Code. 
 
### How to Setup Repl.it
Navigate to [repl.it](https://repl.it/), and create and account. To start programming click the blue "new repl" button on the top right of the website, in the popup, select Java. You should probably name your repl with something that helps you remember what you programmed, like "lesson_1_print_statements" 
 
### How to Setup VSCode
In order to run and program any java applications on your computer you need 2 things: A Java Development Kit (openJDK) and a text editor (VSCode). 
 
* If you have a Windows computer, all you have to do is download [this](https://aka.ms/vscode-java-installer-win) double click and follow the on screen instructions. It will set up VSCode and all the required parts. 
 
* If you have a Mac, download the JDK is [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk13-downloads.html), Choose the "macOS Installer" option. The file name should end with .dmg then open the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions. Then for installing VSCode click on the following [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download), and follow the on-screen instructions after you download the file. After you install VSCode, you will want to install the java extension pack for VSCode [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack)
