Offseason Programming Training 
 
## Setting up a programming environment 
You can either use Repl.it with a web browser such as Firefox or Chrome, or use Visual Studio Code (VSCode) with java on your computer.   
The advantages of using Repl.it are that all you have to do is create an account and start programming, while its disadvantages are that it runs a little slow.   
The advantages of VSCode are that you are using your own computer so it runs faster as well as that VSCode is the editor we use to program the robot, so you will already be used to it. The major disadvatage is that you will have to set it up and it may require some "tweaking" to get working. 
 
### Using Repl.it on the web  
Navigate to [repl.it](https://repl.it/), and create and account. To start programming click the blue "new repl" button on the top right of the website, in the popup, select Java. You should probably name your repl with something that helps you remember what you programmed, like "lesson_1_print_statements" 
 
### Setting up java on your computer  
In order to run and program java applications on your computer you need 2 things: 
 
- A Java Development Kit (openJDK) 
- Some text editor (VSCode) 
 
If you have a Windows computer, all you have to do is download [this](https://aka.ms/vscode-java-installer-win) double click and follow the on screen instructions. It will set up VSCode and all the required parts. 
 
For Mac users you will need to do the following: 
 
Download the JDK is [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk13-downloads.html), Choose the "macOS Installer" option. The file name should end with .dmg then open the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions. 
 
**Next you will need to set up VSCode:** 
 
Go to [this](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) link, and choose the Mac option, then click the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions. 
 
You will want to install the java extension pack for VSCode [here](vscode:extension/vscjava.vscode-java-pack)
