/*
Lesson _08
In this exercise, you will use classes to create a simple calculator
The operation you will be performing will depend on the run variable which will be an enum
For this exercise please create all your classes in one file
Good luck!

    public static void main(String[]args)

        //variables used for calculations
        double numOne = 34;
        double numTwo = 67;
        
        //make objects
        
        //run conditional statements using the run variable
    }

/*
 Make a class called Addition
 * Make necessary variables
 * Make a constructor for that class
 * Make a function called performOperation() that returns the sum of both the numbers
 */

/*
Make a class called Subtraction
* Make necessary variables
* Make a constructor for that class
* Make a function called performOperation() that returns the difference of both the numbers
*/

/*
Make a class called Multiplication
* Make necessary variables
* Make a constructor for that class
* Make a function called performOperation() that returns the product of both the numbers
*/

/*
Make a class called Division
* Make necessary variables
* Make a constructor for that class
* Make a function called performOperation() that returns the quotient of both the numbers
